## 🚀 Features
- 📊 Data preprocessing and cleaning
- 🧩 Feature selection and correlation analysis
- 🤖 Machine learning model training and evaluation
- 📈 Prediction of student performance categories (e.g., Pass/Fail or Grade Level)
- 💻 Interactive interface (can be extended using Flask or Streamlit)
- 🔍 Visualization of important features influencing performance

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- (Optional: Streamlit / Flask for web interface)

## 🧮 Model Workflow
1. Data Collection – Load dataset from CSV or external source.  
2. Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize correlations and distributions.  
4. Model Training – Train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.  
5. Evaluation – Check accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
6. Prediction – Predict student outcomes for new data inputs.
